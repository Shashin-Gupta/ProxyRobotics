# ProxyRobotics

Today we went over all of the important peices of our team going over issues.

- Needed materials and cost of the materials that we would need to finish the robot such as plexiglass
- Next we talked about having another person to acompany Shashin in the code because we need at least two people doing 
everything so we always have a backup
  - This backup ended up being Kush
- We decided to work on more team apparel such as getting our logo on a robot and buying our team shirts 
- We also decided to talk about outreach

We are hoping by the meeting on 12/30 we will be able to do as much as possible so we can leave New Years Eve and New Years Day
as break days.
