# ProxyRobotics

We today have ended up with a few problems such as how to work with the on-bot system. On our own we want to explore using
the code with our Android Studios resources that we already are working with. 

We were unable to tedst the robot but we got a lot of work done with the logo digital design and worked on an email for an
outreach plan that will probably happen within the next week.
